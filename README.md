# Simple Todo

I created this tool because I'm to lazy to open the file and
input the todo item. Instead I spent more time, create a terminal 
command that makes the process faster.

    > todo "This is a todo item"

# Installation
To Come.

# How to use

- Type **todo** with a todo item surrounded with ""
    > $ todo "This is a todo item"
- If file doesnt excist, todo.md will be created.

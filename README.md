# Simple Todo

I created this tool because I'm to lazy to open the file and
input the todo item. Instead I spent more time, creating a terminal 
command that makes the process faster.

    > todo "This is a todo item"

# Installation

*Only works on macOS/Linus at the moment.*

> cd ~

> git clone https://github.com/MatthwFrost/Simpletodo.git

> nano .bashrc

> source ~/.todo.sh



# How to use

- Type **todo** with a todo item surrounded with ""
    '''
    $ todo "This is a todo item"
    '''
- If file doesnt excist, todo.md will be created.

# Simple Todo

I created this tool because I'm to lazy to open the file and
input the todo item. Instead I spent more time, creating a terminal 
command that makes the process faster.

    > todo "This is a todo item"

# Installation

*Only works on macOS/Linus at the moment.*

    > cd ~
    > git clone https://github.com/MatthwFrost/Simpletodo.git
    > nano .bashrc
    > source ~/simpletodo/.todo.sh



# How to use

- Type **todo** with an item you want to input sorrounded with ""
    
    > todo "This is a task"

- Using todo without a item, will make a base file. (Either way, if the file does not exist, one will be created, called "todo.md"
